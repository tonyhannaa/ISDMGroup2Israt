Executive Summary 


Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to develop an information system which will help to improve the efficiency of the operation of the in-house call management centre of the travel company using agile or scrum technology. The purpose of the information system is to provide assistance and match the Relationship Managers with their end customers on the basis of their skills and customer profiles. The system should be able to adjust call flow rate to suitable RMs so they can perform good sales on holiday packages. The aim of the system to provide assistance to RMs is to make sure that the call flow control and call routing for both inbound and outbound calls are improved and dynamic respectively. 
The system should be able to create profiles for customers and RMs. The strategy is to match the 2 entities on the basis of the profile. Creating profile can include basic information like age, sex, culture, laguange proficiency. It could also include social and cultural segments depending on the postcodes and lastname. 
The approach to create the information system includes numerous system development methodologies that we have practised in our subject. Some of the approaches are like using agile methodologies, design thinking.

Design Thinking 

The combination of critical and creative ideas can help improve information systems in dynamic ways. It can find the roots of the problem occurring in the system  as well as help to develop new ideas. The approach always encapsulates customers and is based on their needs which will lead in the development of a customer based IS. 

The five stages of design thinking process is as follows;

Empathize
Define
Ideate
Prototype
Test

Empathise 

The first stage of the design thinking process starts by understanding the needs of the stakeholders. All the requirements should also be enlisted and summarized. The goal to understand the relationship between RM and customers is very vital in this stage.The key to a successful system is to match the profile correctly. This stage in the entire process is vital for a successful development. The process not only includes end customers requirements but also the other stakeholders like relationship managers, employees who are involved in the project. It helps the development team to better understand the requirements as well as expectations. While gathering requirements, the team can create profiles which can later be used to match the relationship managers profile with the end customers. The profile can include age, sex, culture, product knowledge, laguage. An empathy map is drawn below to draw the requirements of the stakeholders of the travel company.

Define the problem 

The first stage of the design thinking deals with the expectation and requirements while on the second stage it is crucial to identify any issues. It is in our best interest for the development team to gather as many requirements in the first stage(Empathize). This will enhance the whole process as deployment, creating prototype and testing will take place as per the requirement. The second stage of the design thinking process is  conducted by evaluating the problems encountered while understanding the requirements of the stakeholders. There will also be cases where the stakeholders may change their requirements time and again. In such cases requirements may have to be changed and problems should be identified again.

After analysing through the requirements the team can come to a conclusion that it is vital that the new system eliminates customers hanging up the calls at busy times.This will not only keep end customers happy but will help to increase sales and increase the rate of customers coming back to the travel company to book holidays . The long wait time is a major factor to be considered that leads to customer hanging up calls. The IS should be able to reduce the wait time so the customers do not have to face any delays. The system should also be able to match the right Relationship manager to the customer. This will save time and can build a good conversation for selling the product.

Considering the identification of the problems encountered in the second stage, the elimination of these issues will enable the company to achieve its goals. This will help the customers to remain in the call, a relationship manager will be available to serve them and a potential sale can be made whereas the company would have lost a customer using their old system. The new system implementation would also reduce the call time or engage customers with the right relationship manager, in this way the customer will not hang up on the call.

### Agile Methodology (Bilal)

Agile methodology is the process in which a team manages a project by breaking it up into smaller more manageable parts and constantly collaborates with stakeholders of the project. The project improves in every iteration. Scrum is the method that has been utilised in this project. Scrum is the most popular agile methodology used [] and assumes that plans need to be changed regularly. Therefore, scrum was the agile methodology chosen for this project. Methods used in this project were daily scrum meetings via messenger chat and calls, everyone would speak about wat they completed, will complete and what is hindering their progress. Furthermore, sprint planning and retrospectives was implemented in the project. At the start of each week the team would be designated goals and on Thursday the team would have a meeting with the stakeholders, to assess the changes in the project and present new ideas.

### Competitive Advantages

Upon execution of the project, there are a variety of competitive advantages that enable this major travel company to be distinct among others. The first competitive advantage is their significant method of improving call routing and dynamic call flow. The system’s ability to match customers with the ideal RM for their enquiry, depending on the customer’s travel destination, language proficiency, etc. not only minimizes the costs by reducing handling time, but also by capitalising client satisfaction as the customer is able to receive the most knowledgeable agent on the other end. Moreover, the fact that a RM will receive a call in their area of expertise signifies that they are most qualified and have actioned the specific package before. This will majorly reduce their after call work which is an extremely critical key performance indicator (KPI) in call management centers (CMC), consequently allowing this RM to action more calls and enhance the overall efficiency and performance of the company. Another competitive advantage that potentially gives this company an upper hand is the interactive voice response unit. The reason for this is that a lot of the time customers call for a simple enquiry which may take the time from a willing customer that is looking for a purchase- therefore by ensuring customers with a high score have a priority, performance is once again maximized as all opportunities are seized. 

While this project enables a number of competitive advantages, if it fails, there are also a number of adversary effects that may harm the company. For example, If the project fails to deliver an Interactive Voice Response unit that successfully branches customers to the appropriate RM, the repercussions will be reflected on the customer’s experience. Moreover, this will lead to one or potentially all of the following: the customer will be directed to an agent that is not familiar with the desired travel package and will therefore not receive optimal assistance; the customer will have to experience one or more call transfers to different managers which can be quite frustrating; and finally, without the navigation options, the customer may be on hold for a long time with no hint on potential call outcome. Overall- all these potential impacts degrade the customer’s experience and may potentially decrease the company’s revenue due to dissatisfaction. Finally, one more negative effect that the company may encounter upon the failure of the project completion is being perceived as a ‘scam’ company for outbound calls, especially if cold calling, assuming a customer target list is not in place. The reason for this is that if customers are not strategically listed on a dialler for certain managers, the call will not be efficiently advertised and therefore poorly communicated. This will lead to a decrease in the Call completion rate KPI, consequently increasing the cost of calls due to unnecessary reaches and decreasing potential revenue that could have been collected by a more qualified and appropriate agent respective of the profiling matches.

### Executive Summary 

The purpose of this report is to outline the strategies involved in improving an existing system for a major travel company. The project intends to improve the operation of their in-house calls using various techniques mentioned below in the project. The first stage of the projects is done by using design thinking analysis. This stage helps to understand the requirements and problems associated with the current system and suggests the changes required. An empathy map is also used in the project to analyze the deeper insight for the Relationship manager and customers. Relationship managers and customers are identified as a major stakeholder in this project. 
The second part of the project gives an idea of the methodology, which is used to enhance the development of the project. 

The third part of the project contains use case diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams and collaboration diagrams. These diagrams help the stakeholders to understand better the process and development strategies as well as support the development team to make a better prototype. The final part explains the advantages and disadvantages of the use of the new system. It underlines the cost-minimizing factors as well as utilizing opportunities in various ways that can help to attract customers.

### Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to develop an information system which will help to improve the efficiency of the operation of the in-house call management centre of the travel company using agile or scrum technology. The purpose of the information system is to provide assistance and match the Relationship Managers with their end customers based on their skills and customer profiles. The system should be able to adjust the call flow rate to suitable RMs so they can perform good sales on holiday packages. The aim of the system to assist RMs is to make sure that the call flow control and call routing for both inbound and outbound calls are improved and dynamic, respectively. The system should be able to create profiles for customers and RMs. The strategy is to match the two entities based on the profile. Creating a profile can include necessary information like age, sex, culture, language proficiency. It could also include social and cultural segments depending on the postcodes and last name. The approach to creating the information system includes numerous system development methodologies that we have practised in our subject. Some of the approaches are like using agile methodologies, design thinking.

The combination of critical and creative ideas can help improve information systems in dynamic ways. It can find the roots of the problem occurring in the system as well as help to develop new ideas. The approach always encapsulates customers and is based on their needs which will lead in the development of a customer based IS.
The five stages of the design thinking process are as follows;

Empathize 
Define 
Ideate 
Prototype 
Test

### Empathize
The first stage of the design thinking process starts by understanding the needs of the stakeholders. All the requirements should also be enlisted and summarized. The goal to understand the relationship between RM and customers is very vital in this stage. The key to a successful system is to match the profile correctly. This stage in the entire process is vital for successful development. The process includes end not only customers requirements but also the other stakeholders like relationship managers, employees who are involved in the project. It helps the development team to understand the requirements as well as expectations better. While gathering requirements, the team can create profiles which can later be used to match the relationship managers profile with the end customers. The profile can include age, sex, culture, product knowledge, language. An empathy map is drawn below to draw the requirements of the stakeholders of the travel company.

### Define the problem

The first stage of the design thinking deals with the expectation and requirements while on the second stage, it is crucial to identify any issues. It is in our best interest for the development team to gather as many requirements in the first stage(Empathize). This will enhance the whole process as deployment, creating prototype and testing will take place as per the requirement. The second stage of the design thinking process is conducted by evaluating the problems encountered while understanding the requirements of the stakeholders. There will also be cases where the stakeholders may change their requirements time and again. In such cases, requirements may have to be changed, and problems should be identified again.
After analyzing through the requirements, the team can come to a conclusion that it is vital that the new system eliminates customers hanging up the calls at busy times. This will not only keep end customers happy but will help to increase sales and increase the rate of customers coming back to the travel company to book holidays. The long wait time is a major factor to be considered that leads to customer hanging up calls. The IS should be able to reduce the wait time, so the customers do not have to face any delays. The system should also be able to match the right Relationship manager to the customer. This will save time and can build a good conversation for selling the product.
Considering the identification of the problems encountered in the second stage, the elimination of these issues will enable the company to achieve its goals. This will help the customers to remain in the call, a relationship manager will be available to serve them, and a potential sale can be made whereas the company would have lost a customer using their old system. The new system implementation would also reduce the call time or engage customers with the right relationship manager; in this way, the customer will not hang up on the call.

### Agile Methodology (Bilal)

Agile methodology is the process in which a team manages a project by breaking it up into smaller more manageable parts and constantly collaborates with stakeholders of the project. The project improves in every iteration. Scrum is the method that has been utilised in this project. Scrum is the most popular agile methodology used [] and assumes that plans need to be changed regularly. Therefore, scrum was the agile methodology chosen for this project. Methods used in this project were daily scrum meetings via messenger chat and calls, everyone would speak about wat they completed, will complete and what is hindering their progress. Furthermore, sprint planning and retrospectives was implemented in the project. At the start of each week the team would be designated goals and on Thursday the team would have a meeting with the stakeholders, to assess the changes in the project and present new ideas.

### Assumptions made in the system analysis. (Bilal)

An assumption made in this system anaylsis is that Israt Fatema is the represntative for all stakeholders, and the meeting is the tutorial with her at 4:30pm Thursday.
